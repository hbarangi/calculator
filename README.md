# calculator
This code creates a basic calculator GUI using the tkinter library in Python. 
The calculator GUI can handle basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
It follows the usual layout of a calculator, with the numbers and operations arranged in a grid. 
Users can click the numbers and operations on the screen to perform arithmetic calculations. 
When a user clicks on a button, the corresponding button_click() function is called which handles updating the display label with the clicked number or operands.
Finally, the result of the operation is obtained by clicking the equal button, which in turn calls the button_equal() function to perform the operation and display the result on the screen.
